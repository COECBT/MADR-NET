## Dataset
The effectiveness of the proposed MADR-Net architecture is evaluated with four publicly available datasets from different image modalities.
* Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-Structure Ultrasound Segmentation (CAMUS) consist of a two-dimensional apical two-chamber and four-chamber view sequence.
* Dermoscopy images were acquired from the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Aided Intervention (MICCAI) conference hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) in 2017 for analysis of skin lesions. 
* FIB-SEM dataset consists of serial section transmission electron microscopy (SSTEM) images acquired from the hippocampus region of the brain. 
* Brain MR images with manual ground truth of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) abnormalities were acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
